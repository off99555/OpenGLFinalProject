# Note
I have used game engines like Unity3D and RPG Maker before. So I know what
OpenGL lack in term of functionality. This project is expected to bring a
game engine-liked functionality into OpenGL by reinventing the wheel.

#Limitation
I have to do everything in one file (because the grading system
doesn't allow uploading multiple files). So, this is quite a mess code in side
**Main.cpp**.
